For all questions, the goal is to create programs :
- puttftp : upload a file on the server
- gettftp : download a file from the same server

question 1, 2 and 3 consist on initialising those programs; getting adress informations, creating a socket and all of what we need to ensure the communication.

Question 4 and 5 create the main program of puttftp and gettftp.
